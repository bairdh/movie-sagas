#Movie Sagas

## Introduction

This it an application that displays the first 10 movies from the database. You can search for movies by name on the main page. Or click on the details of a movie to see it's genre and description. In the details page you can also edit the movie title and description. This can be done by clicking on either the title or description. You can also add and remove genres. Genres are removed by clicking on them, but before they are deleted you will have a prompt asking if you really would like to delete the genre from the movie. You add genres by selecting the genre you would like to add from the drop down menu and clicking 'add genre', 

There is also an Admin feature that is currently in the works that requires a username and password. Once you have logged in you will be able to add and remove movies and genres from the database.

## Code Samples

> You've gotten their attention in the introduction, now show a few code examples. So they get a visualization and as a bonus, make them copy/paste friendly.

## Installation

For this application I used React.js with Redux, Saga, Axios, Material-ui, and Sweet Alerts.
